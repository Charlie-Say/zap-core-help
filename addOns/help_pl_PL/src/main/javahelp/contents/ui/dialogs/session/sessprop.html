<h1>Session Properties dialog</h1>
<p>
This allows you to set the session properties and is made up of the following screens:

<h3>General</h3>
This allows you to set the session name and description.

<h3>Exclude from Proxy</h3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the local proxies.

<h3>Exclude from Scanner</h3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the scanner.

<h3>Exclude from Spider</h3>
This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the spiders (standard and AJAX).

<h3>Contexts</h3>
A set of screens for managing <a href="../../../start/features/contexts.html">contexts</a>

<h2>URL regexs</h2>
In the <i>Exclude from *</i> dialogs, you can enter regular expressions to define excluded URLs.
While you can escape a single meta-character with a backslash, you can also use the <b>\Q...\E</b> escape sequence. All the characters between the <b>\Q</b> and the <b>\E</b> are interpreted as literal characters. E.g. \Q*\d+*\E matches the literal text *\d+*.
This escape sequence is used in ZAP when you exclude URLs via some context menus.
<br>
<b>Note:</b> If your URL contains a "\E", then you have to do the following steps when using the <b>\Q...\E</b> escape sequence:
<ul>
	<li>Open the escape sequence</li>
	<li>Close the escape sequence before the "character" \E</li>
	<li>Escape the backslash</li>
	<li>Open after the "\E" another escape sequence;</li>
	<li>Close the escape sequence as normally would.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Example: subdomain.example.com/path?a=<b>\E</b>&amp;moredata=2 should appear as
<i>\Qsubdomain.example.com/path?a=\E</i><b>\\E</b><i>\Q&amp;moredata=2\E</i>
