<h1>Active Scan tab</h1>

The Active Scan tab allows you to perform an <a href="../../start/features/ascan.html">active scan</a>.<br> 
<br>
The 'Scan Policy Manager' button <img src="../../images/fugue/equalizer.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /> shows the
<a href="../dialogs/scanpolicymgr.html">Scan Policy Manager</a> dialog which allows configuration of <a href="../../start/features/scanpolicy.html">scan policies</a>.
<br><br>
The 'New Scan' button launches the <a href="../dialogs/advascan.html">Active Scan dialog</a> which allows you
to specify exactly what should be scanned.
<br><br>
The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and resume the scan selected.<br>
A progress bar shows how far the scan of the selected site has progressed.<br>
The 'Current scans' value shows how many scans are currently active - 
hovering over this value will show a list of the sites being scanned in a popup.<br>
The 'Show scan progress details' button <img src="../../images/fugue/system-monitor.png" align="bottom" width="16" height="16" /> launches the <a href="../dialogs/scanprogress.html">Scan Progress dialog</a>
which allows you to see details about which rules are running, skip individual rules and see a chart of the responses.

<h2>Right click menu</h2>
Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<h3>Exclude from</h3>
This menu has the following submenus:

<h4>Proxy</h4>
This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP but will not be shown 
in any of the tabs.<br/>
This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you are currently testing.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Scanner</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being actively scanned.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Pająk</h4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being spidered.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h3>New Alert...</h3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/addalert.html">Add Alert dialog</a> which allows you to manually record a new  
<a href="../../start/features/alerts.html">alert</a> against this request.

<h3>Show in Sites tab</h3>
This will show the selected message in the <a href="sites.html">Sites tab</a>.

<h3>Open URL in Browser</h3>
This will open the URL of the selected node in your default browser.
