<h3>Compare with another Session...</h3>
This prompts you for a ZAP session that you have previously saved. <br/>
It then prompts you for an output file into which is written all of the URLs accessed
by the current session and the session you have selected to compare it with.<br/>
The file will contain a table listing the URLs and the HTTP responses for the URLs in the
2 sessions.<br/>
JavaScript buttons allow you to display all of the URLs, just those accessed in the first session,
the second session and those accessed by both sessions.<br/>
This is particularly useful for comparing 2 sessions which access the same application using
different users. You will be able to see which URLs are visible to the users and will be able to
try to access all of the URLs when logged in as either of the users.
