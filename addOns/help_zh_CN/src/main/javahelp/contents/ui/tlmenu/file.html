<h1>文件菜单</h1>
This menu handles the current session. By default the following menu items will be present:<br/>

<h3>新建会话</h3>
这创建了一个新会话。<br>
如果您尚未保存当前会话，则会显示一个警告。<br/>
Starting a new session without saving the current session will loose all of the data in the current session.

<h3>打开会话...</h3>
This opens a session that has been previously saved.<br/>
Opening a session without saving the current session will loose all of the data in the current session.

<h3>Open Recent</h3>
A list of files that have been recently accessed.

<h3>Persist Session...</h3>
This persists the current session. <br/>
While the session is always stored in a database on disk, it will be lost when ZAP is stopped unless it has been persisted.<br/>
You only need to persist it once - after that all changes will be saved.

<h3>Snapshot Session As...</h3>
This saves a snapshot of a session that has already been persisted.<br/>
It will suggest the same filename as the persisted session with a date-time string appended to it, and allow the user to set whatever name they choose.<br/>

<h3>Session Properties...</h3>
This displays the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">会话属性</a> dialog.<br/>
This allows you to set the session name and description.

<h3>Import Context...</h3>
Allows to import a <a href="../../start/features/contexts.html">上下文</a>.

<h3>Export Context...</h3>
Allows to export a Context.

<h3>Load Add-on file...</h3>
Load a local <a href="../../start/features/addons.html">附件</a> file.<br/>
Add-ons are typically installed from via the <a href="../dialogs/manageaddons.html">管理加载项</a> dialog, but this
option can be useful if you have downloaded an add-on manually or are testing one you have developed yourself.<br/>
Add-ons remain installed until you manually uninstall them. 

<h3>Exit and Delete Session...</h3>
This will exit ZAP and delete the session, even if you have previously persisted it.<br/>
The session will no longer be accessible when you restart ZAP, although any snapshots you took will still be available.<br/> 
A warning dialog will be displayed to ensure you really meant to choose this option.

<h3>Exit</h3>
This will exit ZAP.<br/>
If you have not saved the current session then you will be given the option to do so.

<p>
Note that <a href="../../start/features/addons.html">add-ons</a> can add additional menu items.
