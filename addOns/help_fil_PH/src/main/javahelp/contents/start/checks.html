<h1>Mga Patakaran ng Pang-scan</h1>
<p>
ZAP supports both <a href="features/ascan.html">active</a> and 
<a href="features/pscan.html">passive</a> scanning rules.
</p>
<p>
All rules are contained in <a href="features/addons.html">add-ons</a> so that they can be updated quickly and easily.<br/>
By default ZAP ships with just the 'Release' quality rules, but you can install 'Beta' and 'Alpha' quality rules via the
<a href="../ui/dialogs/manageaddons.html">Manage Add-ons dialog</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="features/scanpolicy.html">Scan Policies</a> define which rules run and how they run.<br>
You can have as many scan policies as you like to cover different situations.
</p>
